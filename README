This program gets input and output files by argument vector. The program 
builds a dynamic array inside called lines_len and in each cell it puts from 
the input file the first element of every row that represents the 
length of that row. 
The program will put the next elements of the input row in a two dimension 
dynamic array called the_data.
The program search for the first row that is max_row, meaning that every
cell has the maximum value in all the rows of its column

The program will print in the output file the first max_row or -1 if that row
does not exist

*runtime is O(rows*cols) because we run two times in _the_data (2d array)
 once by its rows and once by its columns

Compile: gcc -Wall ex0a.c -o ex0a
Run: ./ex0a

input:
- input file with integer numbers in it

output:
- in the output file it will print the number of thwe first max_row found 
or -1 if that row does not exist
